   <h2>OUTPUT DEVICES</h2> 
Output devices are devices that provide processed data to the computer user either as hard copy or soft copy. The following are some of the most used output devices in a computer:
<h3>Monitor</h3>
A monitor is a type of display screen that is used to display the soft copy information produced in a computer via the computer’s video card.  The monitor is the main computer output device since the processed data is first seen and confirmed by the user before it can be processed to get a hard copy output.
There are mainly two types of computer monitors i.e. Cathode Ray Tube and Flat Screen Panels.
 <h4>Cathode Ray Tube Screens</h4>
 <img  src="/images/crt-monitor-online tech tips.jpeg" alt="">
 <p>image courtesy of online tech tips</p>
These are the oldest model of computer screens which are large in size, these monitors have some smaller video elements called pixels where the smaller the number of pixels the better the image resolution and vice versa. They are also characterized by higher heat consumption rate.


<h4>Flat screen Panels</h4>
These monitors are reduced in size that of CRT and can carry them or hang them anywhere.they are divided into two Light Emitting Diode (LED) and  Liquid  Crystal Display
 <h4>Liquid Crystal Display</h4>
 <img  src="/images/lcd-lifewire.jpg" alt="">
 <p>image courtesy of livewire.com</p>
Are screens that use optical effects  to convert electrical energy into graphical images /patterns.
 <h4>Light Emitting Diode</h4>
 <img  src="/images/led-indiamart.jpeg" alt="">
 <p>image courtesy of indiamart.com</p>
Are screens that convert electrical energy into light,the main advantage of this screens is that they consume less amount of heat than the CRT and LCD and  this factor therefore makes them more expensive than both the CRT and LCD.
 <h3>PRINTERS</h3>
Are the other most common output devices since they produce the user output as a hard copy  and permanent.
There are basically two types of printers;
<ul><li>Impact printers </li>
<li>Non-impact printers</li>
</ul>  

 <h4>Impact printers</h4>
 <img  src="/images/impact printer-jiji.co.ke.jpg" alt="">
 <p>image courtesy of jiji.co.ke</p>
These printers are called impact since they print characters into a ribbon after which the characters are pressed on the output paper. Thus this printers come into direct contact with the paper being printed.
They are basically of two types;
    <ul><li>Character printers</li>
    <li>Line printers</li>
    </ul> 

<h4>Character printers</h4> 
The character printers are designed to print only one character at a time after the harmer stroke and they can’t print graphics and pictures and hence considered as outdated, this computers are very slow and not mostly used today. They are of two types namely; 
    <ul><li>Dot matrix </li>
    <li>Daisy wheel printers</li> 
</ul>
 <h4>Dot matrix printers</h4>
 
Printers which print characters in a form of a pattern of dots to form a whole character, these patterns are produced by striking the ink soaked ribbon against the paper with a print head.
However these printers are considered as outdated due to higher heat consumption rate.
<h4>Characteristics of Dot Matrix Printers</h4> 
These are very noise when printing
 They are also very slow 
They are very cheap 
They cannot produce pictures 

 <h4>Daisy wheel printers</h4>

This type of printers   consists of a wheel that contains some characters that are mounted on the wheel, to print the characters one has to rotate the wheel until the desired character is placed on the printing location, the harmer then hits the disk which hits the ink ribbon after which the character is pressed on the paper by impact.
Characteristics of  Daisy wheel printers
These types of printers are noisy but not as the dot matrix 
They are slightly expensive than dot matrix 
Their printout quality is better than dot matrix 
They are slow in printing 
Cannot print graphics and images.

<h4>Line printers </h4>
These type  of  printers  print one line at a time.
They are of two types;
<ul><li>Drum printers </li>
 <li>Chain printers</li>
 <h4>Drum Printers</h4>
</ul>
This types of printers are shaped like an ordinary drum and contain characters which are placed on the drum, for one to print, he/she has to rotate the drum where one complete rotation prints one single line, the size of the printer is also equal to the size of the paper. 
This printer’s character font size cannot be changed and are also fast and expensive.
 <h4>Chain printers</h4>
These are line printers whore characters are placed on  a chain, above the chains are some harmers and to print n a paper the paper is place between the harmer and the ink ribbon,
The chain rotates at a higher speed and when a desired character as reached is hit into the paper by the harmer.


<h4>Non-Impact printers </h4>
<img  src="/images/non impact-viva differences.png" alt="">
<p>image courtesy of viva differences</p>
Non-impact printers are printers which do not come into physical contact between the printing mechanism and the paper; they are the commonly used printers and can be used for colored printing and black and white printing.
These printers are of two types:
 <ul><li>Ink jets</li>
 <li>Laser printers</li>
 <h4>Ink jets</h4>
</ul>
This printer contains ink jets which are sprayed on the paper being printed on by the printer head, printing papers are loaded on the printer from the printer trays depending on the type of printer interface, when a printing work is detected the rollers then pull the paper from the trays and then the paper is adjusted  on the printer until the desired image is printed by the printer head. After printing is complete the paper is advance out of the printing area by the rollers.
A stepper motor moves the print head and ink cartridges back and forth during the printing process.
  Characteristics of ink jets
•	They are fast in printing but not as laser 
•	Printout quality is good though not as the laser 
•	They are expensive 
•	They print in color 
•	They produce less noise 

 <h4>Laser printers </h4>
Laser printers are the most expensive printers to be manufactured
These printers are called laser printers due to the term ‘laser’ which means a concentrated beam of light to print/write images and text.

<h4>How it works </h4>

<h4>Characteristics of laser printers </h4>

They are the fastest and can be compared to the photocopier machine 
 They are the most expensive printers 
 They make minimal noise 
 Has the best printout
