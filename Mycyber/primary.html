   <h1> Computer Memories </h1> 
 <h3>Introduction to memories</h3>

Computer memories are data storage components used to store data in a computer for either a long period of time or a short period of time depending on the type memory.
Computer memories are mainly made of semiconductors memories and the magnetic disks though some other materials include like the optical disks among others.
Computer memories can also be categorized as primary memories, cache or secondary memories depending on the type of data they can hold and for what period of time they can hold the data.
 <h3>Primary memories</h3>
 Primary memories are the memories in the computer that store/holds data and instructions that are currently being worked on by the computer. Most primary memories are volatile which means that when power goes off the data stored in them is lost.
One disadvantage of the primary memories is that they are of low capacity and just holds the data that is currently being worked upon the computer.
<h3>Features of the primary memories </h3>
 <ul>
     <li>Accessed directly by processor.</li>
    <li>It is volatile memory</li>
    <li>Are the fastest memories.</li>
    <li>Are semi-conductor memories.</li>
    <li>Are the main memories of the computer.</li>
    
    </ul>



<h3>Types of primary memories</h3>


<h2>RAM</h2>

RAM is a short form for Random Access Memory, as the name suggests the memory is randomly accessed by the processor and hence making retrieval and storage of data easily.
A computer ram is the fastest memory in the computer where all programs and processes in execution are loaded and stored. This memory is very volatile and data is just stored temporarily on it.
Computers can’t run without this memory ,
 <h3>Types of RAM</h3>
 <h3>Dynamic RAM</h3>
This type of Ram loses its charges  easily and hence needs to be refreshed often to prevent data loss.this type of RAM is  cheaper than the ROM and hence most modern PCs run on this RAM.
 <h3>SRAM</h3>
This type of RAM holds its charges for a long period of time and hence can hold data for a longer period of time provided the computer is not switched off and hence there is no need to refresh it.
 <h2>ROM</h2>
It is a short form of Read Only Memory. As the name suggests the ROM data can only be read and cannot be written unto again after manufacturing.
The ROM memory mainly contains those instructions that are regularly used like the booting instructions and procedures and also the booting sequences in the computer. Unlike the RAM, the ROM is non-volatile.ROM memories are mainly chipsets found on the computer.
 <h3>Types of the ROM</h3>
 
  <ul><li>Programmable Read Only Memory(PROM) – it is a type of ROM that can be reprogrammed again by  a program called a programmer.
    This ROM is bought blank and programmer can program it,however this ROM once programmed for the first time it cannot be programmed again hence the name One Time Programmable Device.</li>
<li>Masked ROM (MROM)-Is a type of ROM that once programmed by the manufacturer cannot be programmed again, it is mainly made of integrated circuits.</li>
<li>Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) - this type of ROM can be reprogramed and erased as many times as one can. the process of erasing data in the disk uses a Ultra violet  light which erases the whole data and for one to reprogram it again one has to use a program known as PROM burner.</li>
<li>Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM) - this is a type of ROM that can be programmed and erased many times repeatedly but electrically different from the EPROM that uses the Ultraviolet rays.
    An example of this type of memory is the BIOS of a computer that stores the booting instruction of a computer.</li></ul>

        <td>is less expensive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Is of a higher capacity and large in size</td>
        <td>is just a chipset on the computer.</td>
