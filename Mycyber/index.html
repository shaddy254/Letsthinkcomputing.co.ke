            <h1>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS</h1>
            <P>A computer is an electronic device that accepts data as input,process it to give 
                 the required output as information under the influence of commands and instructions.
                 A computer is generally refered to as an electronic device  since it utilizes electronic signals throughout its operations.<br>
                 The first computer was developed by charles Babbage in 1837 which used punch cards as its Read only Memory, since then many other people
                 and companies have stood in the development of more superior and digital computers used today to perform various multiple tasks.

                 <h3>Qualities of a  computer</h3>
                 <ul>
                 <li>It is automatic- a computer can work with minimum human intervention provided that it is supplied with instructions and data.</li>
                 <li>It is a data Processor - a computer is a data processor since it processes raw facts and figures to produce information as output.</li>
                 <li>It is a storage device - a computer is a storage device since it stores information on the permanet storage memories for future reference.</li>
                 <li>It is electrical- a computer is electrical since it utilizes electrical signals throughout its operations.</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <h3>Avantages of computers</h3>
                 <ul>
                 <li>Speed-computers can perform/work at a very high speed performing complex jobs as compared to human beings.</li>
                 <li>Volume -Computers can perform huge amount of work at the same time</li>
                 <li>Accuracy - computer work is more accurate as compared to work done by human labour.</li>
                 <li>Versatility- Computers can work for a long period of time without being tired or worn out.</li>
                 <li>Secrecy-Data stored in a computer is private to the user as it is secured through the use of passwords.</li>
                 <li>Efficient - computers are efficient since they save on time and space as compared to human beings.</li>
                 <li>Communication - computers provide communication over the internet through websites and softwares 
                     installed in it like facebook,gmail,twitter,whatsapp</li>
                <li>Multi-tasking - computers can perform multiple processes at the same time using the same  micro-processor.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Disadvantages of computers</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Cost- computers are very expensive to purchase and also the overall maintenance time of the computer is very high.</li>
                <li>Computer breakdown - computer breakdown may lead to the breakdown of the  entire work progress in a company and 
                    hence wasting time while waiting for them to be repaired. </li>
                <li>Health Hazard- prolonged use of computers without following the set procedures may lead to some health related problems like eyesight problems and back aches. </li>
                <li>Reduction of labour force -  Introduction of computers into a organization may lead to  unemployment since computers  replace human labour provided by people.</li>
                <li>Moral decay- Computers may lead  to moral decay when used to watch ponography materials.</li>
                <li>Cannot make decisions-computers cannot make decisions on their own and hence human beings are required to provide the best information ever.</li>
                <li>Loss of information-computers may lead to loss of information if they are not managed well in the organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Components of computers</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Hardware - these are the physical  touchable components that make up a computer system.They include keyboard, system unit, monitor,
                    printer and the mouse etc.</li>
                <li>Software-these are set of instructions that make up the computer system and used to tell the computer what task to perform,computers entirely depend on
                    these instructions and cannot perform any task without them.
                </li>
                <li>Liveware- these  are the people who work/interact with the computer,their work is to operate and respond to the computer where necessary.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Computer Experts</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>computer Operators - these are people who have done some computing software packages and know how to operate a computer but not in detail.</li>
                <li>Computer Programmer - Are people who have  know how on programming and can write and execute  programs and aalso test them on a computer.</li>
                <li>Computer Analyst/System Designer - are responsible for creating and integrating computer systems to meet the demands of an organization which
                     may also include installation of softwares.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>HISTORY OF COMPUTERS</h2> 
            <p>In this topic you will be able to know the history and the start of 
                computing in the world which started in the early 40s
            </p> 
            <h2>FIRST GENERATION COMPUTERS</h2>
            <img src="/images/first generation.jpg" alt=""></img>

            <p>The first generation computers were the first computers to be developed                                                                                                                                                            
                in around 1940s,this computers were characterised to 
                store data in magnetic vacuums  and were of large size,this 
                computers were charactrized by a very slow in operation but 
                consumed alot of heat.
               
            </p>
            <h2>The main features of the first generation are − </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vacuum tube technology</li>
                    <li>Unreliable</li>
                    <li>Supported machine language only</li>
                    <li>Very costly</li>
                    <li>Generated a lot of heat</li>
                    <li>Slow input and output devicesy</li>
                    <li>Huge sizey</li>
                    <li>Need of AC</li>
                    <li>Non-portable</li>
                    <li>Consumed a lot of electricity</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Image courtesy of Quora</p>
            <p>these are the second computers to be developed in the year 1950s
                they had a reduced size and were more reliable than the first 
                generation,these computers used the the transistors as their 
                technology.these computers had a small size than the first generation.  
            </p>
            <h2>third generation</h2>
            <img src="/images/third generation computer-tutorials point.jpg">
            <p>Image courtesy of Tutorialspoint</p>
                these computers were more reliable than the first and the second generation 
                computers,these computers had a speed of 1,000,000 operations per second and 
                were multitasking in nature.it is during this generation that saw the 
                introduction of the use of intergrated circuits.
            <h2> fouth GENERATION</h2>

            <p>
                
                Fourth-generation computers were introduced in the 1970’s and developed 
                with microprocessor chip which contains a central processing unit (CPU) on
                a single silicon chip. They perform on the Arithmetic Logical unit and
                control unit of the CPU. these are the computers we use today and are 
                multitasking in nature.

            <p>
            these are the computers that are believed to be developed  from today onwards 
            and are said to have a human like thinking capabilities,these computers are 
            developed with the use of artificial intelligence.</p>
