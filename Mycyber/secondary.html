     <h1>SECONDARY MEMORY</h1>
This is a storage device  that offers a permanent data storage in the computer, they are either inbuilt or external devices, the main advantage of these memories is that they are non volatile and hence data stored on them is not lost when the power goes off and hence  offering a proper storage files for  a longer period of time.
Some of the main storage components in a computer include:
 <h3>Hard disk</h3>

It is a storage device that uses  magnetic storage to store and retrieve the data that is stored in it.
This type storage device contains some round shaped magnetic platters where data is stored ,at the center of the magnetic disks is a  spindle that helps rotate the read/write head for reading and data retrieval.
These memories come with different sizes and it is one of the commonly used secondary storage devices where the Operating System is loaded.
The main drawbacks of these memories are they are very slow due to the rotation of read/write hand and also very noisy.
  
 <h3>Solid State Memories </h3>

The solid state memories comes as an advanced form of the hard disks due to the fact that they do not have  moving component as are very fast and not noisy and consume a less amount of heat.
 <h3>Flash disks</h3>

A storage device used to store data and is connected to the computer through the USB ports, It is a play and plug memory and hence the most commonly used external storage device due to its small size and also the portability factor of it.
 <h3>SD Cards (memory cards)</h3>

A short form of Secure Digital Card.  A storage device mainly used in mobile phones and digital cameras.
For one to connect the memory to a computer he/she has to connect through a SD card reader.
However these memories have started becoming outdated due to presence of mobile phones with higher internal storages.

 <h3>Compact disks</h3>

These are circular disks that use optical rays especially the laser rays to read and white data, these disks are connected to the computer through a CD Drive found on the system unit.
They are of three types namely.
<ul><li>CD ROM - data stored on these devices cannot be written into and is only read. An example of these CD’s is those used to store proprietary software’s and computer games software’s.</li>
<li>CD –Recordable (CDR) – data once stored in this CD’s cannot be deleted or modified later, an example of these CD’s are those used to store music.</li></ul>
<li>CD – Rewritable – data stored in these devices cannot be written or deleted.</li>



 <h3>Digital Versatile Disk (DVD)</h3>

Used to store large multimedia files since they are higher space than that of CD’s,
They are mainly used for high content movies and videos. 
<h3>Differences between the secondary storage memories and the primary memories </h3>
<table style="width:100%" id="t01">

        <th>Secondary Memories</th>
        <th>Primary Memories</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Non volatile memories</td>
            <td>Most primary memories are volatile</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Are Cheaper than primary memories</td>
            <td>Are Expensive than Secondary Memories</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>are either Magnetic or optical</td>
            <td>Are only made of Semiconductor material </td>
        </tr>
        <td>are not accesssed directly by the processor</td>
        <td>are accessed directly by the Computer Processor</td>
        <tr>
            <td>Are slower than primary memories</td>
            <td>Are faster Memories</td>
        </tr>
