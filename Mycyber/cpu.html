    <h1>The Central Processing Unit</h1>

    This is the main component of the computer where all execution and processing of computer programs takes place and also controls all other processes in the computer.
    Components of the CPU
    	<ul>
        <li>Control Unit</li>
        <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit</li>
        <li>Registers</li></ul> 
    	
     <h3>Control unit</h3>
    Also referred to as the nerve center of the computer, this component supervises and oversees all the activities of a computer and monitors the execution of any program being processed.
    <h3>Functions of the control unit</h3> 
    <ul>
    <li>Coordinates and controls the activities of the computer.</li>
    <li>Helps in retrieving and decoding instructions from the internal storage.</li>
    <li>Controls activities of all other units connected to the computer by using the appropriate rule.</li>
    <li>Communicates with I/O devices for transfer of data or results from storage.</li>
</ul>  
   
     <h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit</h3>
    A part of CPU that is responsible for all the mathematical and logical calculations in a computer system.
    This part comprises of two parts ;
     <ul><li>Arithmetic Logic Unit – this section performs all the arithmetic calculations including division, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.</li>
        <li> Logic Section – performs all logic operation in a computer such as comparing, selecting, matching of data and sorting of data.</li>
     
    </ul> 
   
     <h3>Registers</h3>
    This unit stores instructions, data and intermediate results in a computer.
    It supplies information to other units of the computer when needed.
    
    
     <h3>Functions of the cpu</h3>
    Fetch -  taking the instruction from the stored memories and transferring them to the Registers for execution.
    Decode – translating and decoding the assembly code.
    Store  - after execution the results are stored temporarily on the memories. The  CPU registers also store the instruction in execution and also those on their way to the secondary storage memories.
    
     <h3>CPU sockets</h3>
    Sockets are connectors on the motherboard that houses a CPU and forms an electrical interface and contact with the CPU.
    Some of the CPU sockets include;
    <ul><li> Pin Grid Array (PGA) -  this type of socket as the name suggests  has some pins which are attached to the main carrier that houses the CPU and then the carier is attached to the  motherboard.  </li>

    <li>Line/Land Grid Array -   the LGA socket is the opposite of the PGA and hence it has  the pins attached in the main sockets itself rather than on the motherboard.</li>

    <li>Zero Insertion Force – as the name suggests this type of socket needs no force for one to place the CPU on it.one has to just gently   drop the CPU into the socket and then lock it to the socket using a lever that is placed near the socket, by just moving it outwards horizontally one unlocks the socket  and to lock it one has to move the lever inwards horizontally.</li>
